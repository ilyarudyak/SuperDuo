### Buttons
1. We use both raised button `Search` and flat buttons `Clear` and `Add`. We emphasize our search function. And we use flat buttons to clear form or add a book to our library. From documentation: 

>Only mix button types when you have a good reason to, such as emphasizing an important function. If your app requires actions to be persistent and readily available to the user, consider using persistent footer buttons, which are also easily accessible. Never use raised buttons within persistent button areas.
